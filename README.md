# E-Store Mobile App Home Screen

This Flutter project recreates an electronics store home screen mockup. The mockup was created by [@nasyiya.design](https://www.instagram.com/p/CPuiTJtrm7w/) on instagram.


I saw the mockup on instagram and thought it would be interesting to recreate it in Flutter as my first real stab at making something fully in it.
